Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how our app handles user data.

1. Information We Collect
We do not collect any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email, phone number, or contact list) through this app.

However, the app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

2. Advertising
We use Google AdMob to serve ads within the app. AdMob and its partners may collect and use personal data, including:

Your Advertising ID (via ACCESS_ADSERVICES_AD_ID, com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID)

Device information

App usage data

This information is used to show relevant and personalized ads. AdMob and its partners may also use cookies and other tracking technologies to personalize ads and measure performance.

You can learn more about how Google uses data here:

You can manage ad personalization in your device settings or at:
ðŸ‘‰ https://www.google.com/settings/ads

The app may also use Androidâ€™s advertising services APIs (such as ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION and ACCESS_ADSERVICES_TOPICS) for ad attribution and interest-based advertising.

3. License Verification
The app uses Google Playâ€™s license verification (com.android.vending.CHECK_LICENSE) to confirm that you have a valid copy. No personal data is collected or stored during this process.

4. Local Data Storage
The app uses local storage to save your settings and preferences. This information is stored only on your device and is not shared externally.

Technologies used include:

shared_preferences (for saving preferences)

sqflite (for local database storage)

5. Connectivity Monitoring
The app accesses your network connection status (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE) to check whether you are connected to the internet. No personal or location data is collected during this check.

6. Foreground Service & Wake Lock
The app may use foreground services (FOREGROUND_SERVICE) and request the device to stay awake (WAKE_LOCK) to ensure that certain tasks (such as notifications or ongoing processes) can run reliably. No personal data is collected or transmitted as part of these processes.

7. Internal Broadcast Receiver
The app includes internal permissions (com.kudamono.yepone.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION) for secure communication within app components. This does not involve collecting or sharing any user data.

8. Data Sharing and Compliance
We do not collect or share personal information ourselves. However, third-party services (such as Google AdMob and Google Play services) may collect and process data according to their privacy policies.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, California, or other regions with data protection laws, you have certain rights under applicable privacy laws, including:

The right to access, correct, or delete your personal data

The right to object to or restrict certain processing

The right to opt out of personalized ads (via your device settings or Googleâ€™s ad settings)

We comply with all applicable privacy laws.

9. Security
We are committed to protecting your data. Although no data is transmitted to our servers, we take steps to secure data stored locally on your device and ensure compliance with Google Play policies.

10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating this page. Please review this policy periodically for updates.
